# Signatures

Borrowing to the point of theft from https://github.com/Rosuav/StilleBot.

## Dependencies

- gtk2 (`brew install gtk+`)
- Pike 9+
- Image Magic (`brew install imagemagick`)
â€“ Tesseract

## Development

There's an `.editorconfig` file to help with consistency between devs and environments.
For VS Code [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) will enable it.
There are extensions for other editors as well.

### Pike

Array `({})`
Mapping `([])`
Set `(<>)`
Split string `string / "boundary"`
While app is running, type `update` to hot reload.
A file is a class (or "program" (from LPC)) in Pike, so at top of file you can: `inherit`.
Create a program within a program (file/class) using the `class` keyword. This will be of _type_ `program`.
`@` is the spread operator

To get extra debug information on stdout: `pike -DSP_DEBUG app`

## Markdown Parsing

Markdown elements can receive a following  `> `

The `render()` method of `http_request` (which inherits from (currently) `websocket_handler`) accepts
a mapping, which is a set of replacements.
When `vars` is submitted, it writes js vars into a script tag.
There are also some defaults, for example `ws_type` and `ws_code`, which
default to the module name (eg `index` and `/static/index.js`) _if_ `ws_group` is
present.
For example:
```
return render(req,
	([
			"vars": (["ws_group": "", "helloworld": 1234]),
			"foo": "foo-value",
	]));
	```

Will yield:
```
<script>let helloworld = 1234;
let ws_group = "";
let ws_type = "index";
let ws_code = "/static/index.js";
let ws_sync = null; import('/static/ws_sync.js?mtime=1711459399').then(m => ws_sync = m);</script>
```

Here's an example markdown with additional variables (and defaults) defined:

```
constant markdown = #"# PageFlow Index Screen

* This is a variable: $$foo$$
* This variable has no value but a default: $$bar||bar-default$$
";
```

Markdown can be rendered directly via the http module (`index.pike`, etc), or via
a `.md` file with matching name. The one in the pike file takes precedence.

### Utilities
`pike app.pike --exec=update_page_bounds`
`pike app.pike --exec=compare_scores`
`pike app.pike --exec=audit_score`

### Tesseract

We use Tesseract to generate a text bounding box on template and submitted files.
Tesseract's `makebox` param generates `w 92 708 100 73 0` for each line where
the five columns are the found letter, the four coordinates and the page number.

### Audit Rectangles

For each page template, a number of audit rectangles are stored.
Each submitted file is compared to matching template and scored
based on the dark/light transition count within the bounds of the
rectangle area.
To account for varying margins between template file and submitted file,
the bounds of page text area are calculated and when comparing each
rectangle is rescaled proportionally to the page bounds, with
corresponding margins adjusted to match the saved page rect (which
does not take into account page text bounds).
