## Pale Image Detection
Some scans are turning out too pale for useful transition detection. Others may end up too dark. Need to determine a threshold of darkness to recognize a transition (currently using 128).

Possibilities: Take the average() of the entire image; take the min() and max() and split the difference; do all of the above based on the bounding box.

Also may be worth using a percentile check. Find the pixel value such that 99% of the image is darker than it, and one such that 99% is lighter than it. Half way between those is our transition point (or other figures than 99%).

Alternatively, define a transition not as "above" and "below" a fixed point, but as a sufficient delta from the previous pixel value.

What constitutes sufficient? What if it transitions slowly over several pixels? So maybe we need to consider a "low" and "high" "water mark" for each strip.

Getting threshold based on a single Tesseract makebox box
might be useful.

## Logins
On login, assume for now tagtech userbase, get user details from MySql database and synchronize with psql db.
Eventually we would like TagTech to be one possibility in the user credentials, but that probably won't be sufficient.
Set everything else up accordingly.
Session Expiration
