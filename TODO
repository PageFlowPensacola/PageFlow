- implement template handler

- S3 client connectivity (for uploading files)
- http statics handler (images, cache-busting, javascript)
- http request decorator to demand authentication

- inheritable REST endpoint
- inheritable web socket handler
- create markdown system for serving html responses

- (JS) grab pike from git, build
- mysql deprecations (we have altered pike's database code)

- consider modules directory structure. will we have any non-http modules?

- investigate connection pooling, transactional integrity

Serve a front end.
Static file subsystem for js, css, html
maybe not markdown. just a single static html page.

## BEFORE MOVING TO PRODUCTION

Enforce ip restrictions at both token generation and login
add user_org joins to relevant queries to authorize user has access to this org
Currently calls DB for each audit rect when updating transitions score.
Add support for DB transactions and queue which will probably require making a connection pool.

## ENHANCEMENTS

Ability to load multiple template pages tabs.
Return actual minified thumbnails.
Manage broken/non PDF submissions

## TOMORROW
calc and store page bounding on template upload
Update compare_transition_scores to consider page bounds
on analysis submission generate page bounds and compare accordingly
display feedback in interface
integrate the ML endpoint
LOGIN RESULT from Pike is not working, at least on invalid credentials.

## Interface

Pagination of template pages
Page size display in analysis
	smaller with flexbox click dlg cursor zoom-in
(enhancement) Ability to hide audit rect result display
Image border colors
(maybe) display page details in line with page
Indicate the page number inset
#### TEMPLATES

##### Layout
1. Click on an audit rect to open a dialog (select signatory, delete). Replace the right-hand column with this.
2. Color code audit rects based on signatory
3. Have a predefined color sequence for signatories
	#faf #ffa #aff, #faa, #afa, #aaf
	alternatively #f0fa, #ff0a, #0ffa, #0f0a, #00fa, #f00a
	to extend #808a, #880a, #088a
4. Allow user to edit color for any signatory (enhancement)
5. NULL is permanently striped diagonal rebecca purple

##### Navigation

Look at the current page
See if we need to cycle through
Display navigation accordingly
|< < Current page: 2 > >|
Disable first and last on first page
Click title to reach top level template page.

##### Misc

Add new signatory in Rect Dlg
Exclusion Index Constraint on Audit Rects via Postgres

## MONDAY
Some scans are turning out too pale for useful transition detection. Others may end up too dark. Need to determine a threshold of darkness to recognize a transition (currently using 128).

Possibilities: Take the average() of the entire image; take the min() and max() and split the difference; do all of the above based on the bounding box.

Also may be worth using a percentile check. Find the pixel value such that 99% of the image is darker than it, and one such that 99% is lighter than it. Half way between those is our transition point (or other figures than 99%).

Alternatively, define a transition not as "above" and "below" a fixed point, but as a sufficient delta from the previous pixel value.

What constitutes sufficient? What if it transitions slowly over several pixels? So maybe we need to consider a "low" and "high" "water mark" for each strip.

Getting threshold based on a single Tesseract makebox box
might be useful.

##### Archive Migration

- ssl

1. User
   - Roles ( org-level admin, org-level user, suborg-level user )
   - 2fa - oauth with google or other account (Check with Frank on option to create google account)
   - audit trail - appendning toward append-only
   - impersonation
   - remember me
   - state preservation between logins (restore ui position on login)

2. Domain (formerly org)
   - Tree - root is pageflow
   - offer subdomains in org tree
   - remember as part of state preservation
   - domain-level module availability
   - Shipping labels
   - manifests

3. Document (dealjacket, template, mtr, etc)
   - upload
   - search
   - transactionality w/ aws
   - revisit aws structure
   - doctypes (dealjacket, financial, hr)

4. Search
   - full-text serch in postgres
   - future: advanced search

5. Pipeline - river
   - pdf processing
   - image processing
   - data munging
   - model management/training
   - data model?

## May 30
On login, assume for now tagtech userbase, get user details from MySql database and synchronize with psql db.
Eventually we would like TagTech to be one possibility in the user credentials, but that probably won't be sufficient.
Set everything else up accordingly.

 ## July 4
Session Expiration
Replace com.pageflow.tagtech.dunder-mifflin. in templates.js
Reenstate login form in header
Update Favicon
We are currently missing "field" from domains com.pageflow.{dealership.automotive}.etc...
Filter domain select to single level of child.
