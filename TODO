- implement template handler

- S3 client connectivity (for uploading files)
- http statics handler (images, cache-busting, javascript)
- http request decorator to demand authentication

- inheritable REST endpoint
- inheritable web socket handler
- create markdown system for serving html responses

- (JS) grab pike from git, build
- mysql deprecations (we have altered pike's database code)

- consider modules directory structure. will we have any non-http modules?

Serve a front end.
	Static file subsystem for js, css, html
		maybe not markdown. just a single static html page.
